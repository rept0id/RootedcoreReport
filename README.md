# History of this repo

Well, this is one of the first software written by me. Story starts back at around 2012, then this, last version, around 2014. 

We had formed a team with some colleagues, called Rootedcore. This is were I searched, using wayback machine, to find my script.

I was inspired by one of [colder-is-better's](https://github.com/colder-is-better), known also as subZraw from "total hacker", book "total linux". There, you were able to find a similar BASH script that reported you, using HTML in order to give a graphical experience, a bunch of info about your machine.

# Point of this repo

This is just for nostalgic reasons, its in my plans to writte down a newer version. 

***Still, this version tries its best for a software written by a newbie guy barely knowing what he was doing !***

Special thanks to colder-is-better. That guy teached us many interesting things, including DDOS, hi-jacking of DNS infrastructure, brute-forcing md5 hashes (they were still a thing), reverse engineering of binary code, rooting & jailbraking of machines and most impotantly, that computing is a life-time adventure, all through "total hacker".

***Let's keep computing fun !***
