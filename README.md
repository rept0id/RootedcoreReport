Well, this is one of the first software written by me. Story starts back at around 2013, then this, last version, around 2015. 

We had formed a team with some colleagues, called Rootedcore, which is were I searched, using wayback machine, to find my script.

I was inspired by colder-is-better's book "total linux". There, you were able to find a similar BASH script that reported you, using HTML in order to give a graphical experience, a bunch of info about your machine.

This is just for nostalgic reasons, its in my plans to writte down a newer version. 
Still, this version tries its best for a software written by a newbie guy barely knowing what he was doing.

Enjoy !
